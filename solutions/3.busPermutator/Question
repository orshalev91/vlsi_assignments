I was thinking about how to implement with 8x3 lines
and what I had in mind is 8 switch cases for each output bit to select between each input bit

case (select[x:x-2]):
    0 : dout[x/3] <= din [0]
    1 : dout[x/3] <= din [1]
    ....

But it would be a wrong solution because it can return an answer that is built by only part of the input bus
How can I add a dependency in this case?
